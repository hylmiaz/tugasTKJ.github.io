                At 9 am, my mom and I arrived at school. Ready to receive my
                report card. My mom entered room 10 while I waited outside
                chatting with my friends.
              </p>
              <p>
                A few minutes later, my mom came out of the room. I asked her
                about my results. Thank God, the results were great.
              </p>
              <p>
                Before returning home, I went to the DTF booth. There was a lot
                of wooden furniture for sale. I came there just to pick up the
                table I ordered. I paid for it and took it home.

                Ulil and I went to the Jami al Furqon Mosque for Friday prayers.
                We prayed on the outside of the mosque because it was full
                inside. We quietly listened to the khutbah and waited for the
                iqamah.
              </p>
              <p>
                When the imam said the salam, I heard the noise of children
                running to the side of the mosque. After praying, We went to the
                side of the mosque. Sure enough, there was a rice box giveaway.
                We lined up and got a rice box each.

                While we were eating our rice boxes, my friend, Agi, texted me.

                I asked Ulil if he wanted to come. Unfortunately, he couldn't
                come because he wanted to go to his grandmother's house. So, I
                went alone to SMPN 200 to watch the drama performance.
              </p>
              <p>
                When I arrived at SMPN 200, I saw Agi sitting on a bench. He
                came up to me and we had a little chat. Since the performance
                started in 5 minutes at 2 pm, we went to the registration desk.
                We re-registered and sat in the audience seats.
              </p>

              <p>
                At 2 pm, the show began. The actors were ready in their
                positions. The drama performance was very interesting and
                meaningful. The performance lasted for 20 minutes. The
                performance ended with a loud applause. Before going home, we
                took a group photo with the actors.

                We went to the spot with our gear. When we arrived, we
                immediately prepared our fishing rods. While waiting, we took a
                walk around the river where we were fishing.
              </p>
              <p>
                As time passed, we saw the sun setting on the west horizon. But
                we hadn't hooked a single fish yet. We decided to return home
                empty-handed.

              <p>
                We had planned to go shopping at the flea market for a long
                time, and tomorrow was the day. The idea of going there is to
                search for second-hand items that are still good. I was planning
                to find a watch or a camera there. Therefore, today we prepared
                our preparations for the journey tomorrow.
              </p>
              <p>
                I packed up my preparations and headed to Obon's house. There we
                spent time chatting and playing games. Because we felt hungry,
                we bought some food and ate it together. When it was midnight,
                we quickly went to bed.

              <h3 class="time" time="Morning">Wake up, It's the Day!</h3>
              <p>
                In the morning, we prepared to leave. We had breakfast and took
                a shower. We headed to Kranji Station by motorcycle. Once there,
                we stopped by Indomaret to charge our balance and grab a coffee.
                After that, we entered the station and waited on the platform.
              </p>
              <p>
                The train came after 10 minutes of waiting. We were so lucky
                that the train wasn't too crowded, so we were able to sit down.
                After 20 minutes of the train ride, we finally arrived at
                Jatinegara Station.
              </p>
              <p class="time" time="Noon">
                As we exited the station, it started to rain. We were forced to
                take cover. When the rain stopped, we continued our journey to
                the Jatinegara Flea Market.
              </p>
              <p>
                There were a lot of interesting items. However, we didn't buy
                any of them. Because some of the items are relatively expensive
                and the items may not work properly. So, we decided to return to
                the station and have something to eat.

              <h3>Plan B, I Guess...</h3>
              <p>
                At the station we had a discussion to determine our next
                destination. We decided to continue our journey to Pasar Senen
                Station. The point of going there was to do some thrifting.
                After 15 train rides, we arrived at Pasar Senen Station.
              </p>
              <p>
                We immediately headed to the Pasar Senen thrifting site to look
                for cheap imported clothes. There I bought a pair of shirts, a
                pair of trousers, a jacket, and a long coat. The clothes I got
                were great quality; some of the clothes were from Korea and
                Japan. After shopping, we returned to the station and went home.

                At 3 pm, my family and I went to Tambun Rengas for a big family
                gathering. Once there, I helped my family to prepare the grill.
                We grilled fish and corn. After we finished grilling, we ate
                together, starting with a prayer.

                Because I ate so much, I felt sleepy. To fight off the
                sleepiness, I played a little game. After 1 hour of gaming, I
                felt even more sleepy. I decided to sleep rather than watch the
                fireworks outside.

              <h3 class="time" time="Noon">Last Friday Before School</h3>
              <p>
                Just like the previous Friday, Ulil invited me to Friday prayer
                together. Unlike the previous Friday, this Friday we prayed at
                Al Hikmah Mosque. But the atmosphere was still the same; when
                the imam said the salam, there was a rush of children running to
                the exit. Unfortunately, we didn't get a rice box.
              </p>
              <p>
                Before we headed back home, we went to the agricultural site
                first. The air was very fresh there. There was also a lake where
                we used to do some fishing. There we also did a bit of
                exploring.
              </p>
              <p>
                Because we were hungry, we decided to go home. On the way home
                we decided to go to Marunda Beach in the afternoon. We invited
                our friends through group chat. Unfortunately, no one could
                come.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div class="subchapter">
              <h3 class="time" time="Afternoon">I Wonder What's Inside</h3>
              <p>
                In the afternoon, Ulil and I headed to Marunda Beach. In the
                middle of the road we looked at the abandoned apartments. We
                wondered what was going on there. Out of curiosity, we tried to
                enter the area of the apartment.
              </p>
              <p>
                The atmosphere there was very quiet and creepy; it felt like an
                old building in a horror movie. It was very messy; there was a
                lot of broken glass on the floor, and the building looked like
                it was going to collapse. For that reason, we didn't enter the
                building. We just took some photos there and continued our
                journey to Marunda Beach.
              </p>
              <img src="image/marunda-apartment.jpg" />
              <p>
                When we arrived at Marunda Beach, we took a deep breath. It felt
                very fresh with a slight scent of sand. We looked for a place to
                sit and lean back. The sound of the waves was very soft. We
                spent some time there studying. When evening time came, we went
                home.
